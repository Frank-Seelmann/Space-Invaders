# Space-Invaders - Spring 2020

This Python program runs a simple version of the classic Space Invaders game.
For my Discrete Mathmatics for Computing course, we had to create a Python project that demonstrates
some sort of algorithm. This is not that project. Since I had no experience Python or "Pygame," I decided
Space Invaders was a simple enough start.
